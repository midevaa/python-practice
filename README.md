1. I created a list of numbers. I used sum function to generate the addition of all elements in the list. Used variable total to store the sum of the list. 
2. The user is prompted to write a number. The number is checked if it is divisible by 2. If it is, it prints the number is even else odd
3. The user is prompted to input a number. If the number is negative, there's a warning because factorials of negatives are undefined else using a for loop, the factorial is calculated and the result is printed.
4. The code prompts a user to enter a string. I initialized an empty string used to hold the reversed string. I used to loop to go through each character in the original string and adds it to reversed string. The reversed string is printed.
5. I defined a recursive function factorial(n). Prompted user to enter a number, then if the number is negative, it notifies the user that it needs a positive number else calculates and prints the factorial of the number input.
6. Code prompts the user to enter a number. I created the sum_digits function which converts the integer to a string to loop through each number. They also converts it back to an integer and they are sumed. The total sum is displayed.
